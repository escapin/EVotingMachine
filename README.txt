This package contains source files and additional verification
files for formal verification of an electronic voting system. 

The sources are in the folder src.

static IFC check
================

For your convenience, we provide an ant script to perform the static non-interference verification of the example code.

Requirements:
  * Ant >= 1.9.3
  * Java 1.6+

Make sure that 'java', 'javac' and 'ant' can be executed from your shell. To invoke the static analysis, just run 'ant' or 'ant ifc'. This will build the example code and the analysis code and run the analysis on the example. Additionally, a PDG is produced for further inspection. If you change the source code and run 'ant' again, the code will be re-compiled and the re-compiled code will by analyzed.



KeY proofs
================

Loading the proofs best works with the latest release 2.4,
that can be downloaded from http://key-project.org/download/index.html
Other versions are not tested. Running KeY requires Java 1.6 or later.

The folder "proof" contains all proof scripts for the case study.
Each .proof file corresponds to one method in the Java source
that has been verified against a JML specification.
To replay and investigate the proofs, start KeY and open a .proof file.
This will immediately trigger a proof replay, which may take some seconds.
After that, you may inspect all proof steps (i.e., rule applications).

To just check the proof scripts being valid, you may also use KeY in command
line mode (provided that you have a non-JAR version of KeY). 
Type "key --auto-loadonly xx.proof" on the command line.

Comprehensive statistics are provided in the file proof/statistics.csv,
that can be loaded as a CSV table with "|" as delimiters (but not commas).

To repeat the proofs on your own, load the file project.key in KeY with GUI.
You are prompted for a verification target (i.e., Java method).
All proofs can be found without user interaction; you may just press the
auto mode button (green "play" button).
Note that JML specifications are written in the original Java sources.


Additional side effect analysis
================

As mentioned in the paper, we have used results that calling the logging
component only has benign side effects. The results provided by Joana are
listed in folder "sideeffects". For each caller context (i.e., calling method),
an upper bound of affected heap locations is listed. These locations do not
appear syntactically in the specification of the respective methods. Therefore,
it can be assumed without loss of generality that these side effects were not
present at all.
